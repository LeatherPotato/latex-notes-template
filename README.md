# My LaTex Notes Template
Thnk you for checking out my latex notes template. please star it or something -- idk how gituhb works, but i want more of whatever the social currency here is :]

## What different files and directories should be used for

- **main.tex** is for defining sections (chapters) and section titles. all other text should be kept in its own file for organistationa and then inputted to the main.tex with \input.
- **preamble.sty** is for including any packages or setting up commands or anything of that sort. keeps main.tex cleaner
- **chapters/** is where you keep all of the other .tex files that you'll import into the main.tex file.
- **images/** is where all images are kept (i also like to keep the source files i make the diagrams with in my images folder). figures created in latex with any packages can be kept in their respective files if they arent exported to an external image.
- other directories can be made for other kinds of files (e.g. if any data is being saved for plotting then keep that in its own directory or make a misc/ directory).

## Other stuff ill incrimentally add here later when needed
